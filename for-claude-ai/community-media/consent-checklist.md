# Consent Checklist: Complete Reference

*For BLKOUT Community Media producers and editors*

---

## Core Principles

Consent in community media is not a checkbox — it's a practice. These aren't bureaucratic requirements; they're how we honor the people who trust us with their stories.

1. **Informed** — People know what they're agreeing to
2. **Ongoing** — Consent can be withdrawn; circumstances change
3. **Specific** — Different uses may require different permissions
4. **Documented** — We can show what was agreed
5. **Protective** — We hold more care than strictly required

---

## Pre-Recording Consent

### Before Invitation

- [ ] **Format clarity**: Can you clearly explain what they're being invited to?
- [ ] **Use clarity**: Can you clearly explain how the content will be used?
- [ ] **Risk assessment**: Have you considered any particular sensitivities for this person/topic?

### Invitation Stage

- [ ] **Written briefing sent**: Briefing document appropriate to format
- [ ] **Consent terms included**: Core terms explained in briefing
- [ ] **Questions invited**: Clear path to ask questions before agreeing
- [ ] **Opt-out easy**: No pressure language; declining is explicitly okay

### Confirmation Stage

- [ ] **Participation confirmed**: Explicit agreement received (email/message)
- [ ] **Terms acknowledged**: They've confirmed they've read and understood the terms
- [ ] **Questions answered**: Any questions they raised have been addressed
- [ ] **Special considerations noted**: Any specific requests or concerns documented

---

## Recording Consent

### At Start of Recording

- [ ] **Verbal confirmation**: "Before we start, I want to confirm you're happy to proceed on the terms we discussed. Any questions?"
- [ ] **Recording notice**: "I'm now starting the recording"
- [ ] **Brave space reminder**: "Remember, this is a brave space — you can pause or stop at any time"

### During Recording

- [ ] **Check-ins as needed**: If conversation goes to sensitive territory, pause to check in
- [ ] **Respect hesitation**: If they seem uncomfortable, acknowledge and offer to move on
- [ ] **No pressure for disclosure**: Never push for more than they want to share

### Before Ending Recording

- [ ] **Anything to add**: "Is there anything you'd like to add or clarify?"
- [ ] **Anything to flag**: "Is there anything you've said that you'd like us to be particularly careful with in the edit?"
- [ ] **24-hour reminder**: "Remember, you have 24 hours to request any cuts — just email me"

---

## Post-Recording Consent

### Immediate (Within 2 Hours)

- [ ] **Thank you email sent**: Confirms participation and restates 24-hour window
- [ ] **Contact clear**: They know who to contact for edit requests
- [ ] **Timeline shared**: When they can expect to see the edit

### 24-Hour Window

- [ ] **Window tracked**: Clear record of when 24 hours ends
- [ ] **Requests received**: Any edit requests documented
- [ ] **Requests honored**: All reasonable requests actioned
- [ ] **Confirmation sent**: If changes made, confirm what was removed

### Edit Review

- [ ] **Draft shared**: Participant sees edit before publication
- [ ] **Adequate time**: At least 48 hours to review (more if possible)
- [ ] **Feedback incorporated**: Any concerns addressed
- [ ] **Final approval**: Explicit sign-off received

---

## Special Consent Considerations

### Third Parties Mentioned

When a participant mentions someone else by name:

- [ ] **Identified in edit review**: Flag all named third parties
- [ ] **Necessity assessed**: Is naming them essential to the story?
- [ ] **Risk assessed**: Could identification harm them?
- [ ] **Options presented**: Can we anonymize? ("a friend", "someone I knew")
- [ ] **Participant consulted**: Their preference on how to handle
- [ ] **Editor decision**: Final call documents reasoning

**Default**: Remove or anonymize unless there's clear reason to keep and no evident risk.

### Sensitive Disclosures

When someone shares something that could affect them if public:

- [ ] **Identified in edit review**: Flag health, trauma, relationships, family, employment
- [ ] **In-moment check**: Did we check in during recording?
- [ ] **Highlight for participant**: Draw attention to this in draft review
- [ ] **Explicit confirmation**: "You shared X — are you comfortable with this being public?"

### Identity Disclosures About Others

When someone outs or identifies another person:

- [ ] **Automatic flag**: This should always be caught
- [ ] **Default removal**: This should not be published without exceptional reason
- [ ] **Participant informed**: Explain why this is being removed
- [ ] **Context preserved**: Find alternative framing that protects the third party

**This is non-negotiable**: We do not out people, ever, regardless of participant's wishes.

### Minors

If anyone under 18 is discussed or involved:

- [ ] **Heightened scrutiny**: Additional care in all decisions
- [ ] **Anonymization default**: Minors should not be identifiable
- [ ] **No imagery**: Do not generate images depicting specific minors
- [ ] **Story permission**: If telling a story significantly about a minor, consider whether it's theirs to tell

## Editor's Duty of Care

Even when participants don't flag concerns, editors must independently assess:

### Proactive Checks

- [ ] **Employment risk**: Could this harm their job or career?
- [ ] **Family risk**: Could this damage family relationships?
- [ ] **Safety risk**: Could this put them in physical danger?
- [ ] **Future self risk**: Might they regret this in 5, 10, 20 years?
- [ ] **Community risk**: Could this harm their standing in communities they value?

### When to Act Unilaterally

If you identify significant risk that the participant hasn't flagged:

1. **Raise it with them first**: "I noticed you said X — I want to flag that this could potentially [risk]. Are you comfortable with it staying in?"

2. **If they want to keep it**: Document the conversation. Respect their autonomy unless risk is severe.

3. **If risk is severe**: Reserve the right to remove even against their wishes. Explain clearly why. This should be rare.

### Documentation

For any duty of care intervention:
- What was the concern?
- Was it raised with participant?
- What was their response?
- What was the final decision?
- Who made it?

## Publication Consent

### Pre-Publication

- [ ] **Final edit approved**: Explicit participant sign-off
- [ ] **Publication date agreed**: Participant knows when it goes live
- [ ] **Platform confirmed**: They know where it will appear
- [ ] **Promotional use**: They know clips may be used on social media

### At Publication

- [ ] **Notification sent**: Participant told it's now live
- [ ] **Links provided**: They can find and share it
- [ ] **Thanks expressed**: Appreciation for their contribution

### Post-Publication

- [ ] **Monitoring**: Watch for any concerns that arise
- [ ] **Responsive**: Quick response if participant raises issues
- [ ] **Removal path clear**: They know they can request removal

---

## Archive & Removal

### Default Position

- Content is public and perpetual
- Participant can request removal at any time
- Valid reasons include: changed circumstances, personal safety, changed views, "I've changed my mind"

### Removal Request Process

1. **Receive request**: Document date and reason given
2. **Acknowledge**: Respond within 48 hours
3. **Assess**: Is this straightforward or complex?
4. **Action**: Remove from all platforms where feasible
5. **Confirm**: Tell participant what was removed and from where
6. **Archive**: Keep internal copy with removal documentation

### What We Can't Remove

- Content that has been legitimately copied by others
- Content in web archives (though we can request removal)
- Screenshots or recordings made by third parties

We should be honest about these limitations.

## Quick Reference: Red Lines

Things we never do, regardless of consent given:

1. **Out someone** — Reveal someone's sexuality, gender identity, HIV status, etc. without their explicit, informed consent for that specific disclosure
2. **Identify minors** — Name or make identifiable children in contexts that could harm them
3. **Enable harm** — Publish content we believe will lead to physical harm
4. **Misrepresent** — Edit someone's words to change their meaning
5. **Ignore withdrawal** — Once consent is withdrawn, we stop using the content
