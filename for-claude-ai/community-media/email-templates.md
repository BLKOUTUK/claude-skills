## 3. Thank You Email (Post-Recording)

**Subject:** Thank you — and next steps

---

Hi [Name],

Thank you for being part of [Format Name] [yesterday/on Date]. [One specific thing you appreciated about their contribution — be genuine].

**Your 24-hour edit window is now open.**

If there's anything you'd like us to cut or adjust — moments that felt too raw, stories that on reflection you'd rather not share publicly, anything at all — let me know by [specific time/date].

After that window closes, we'll proceed with editing. You'll hear from us again when it's ready to publish.

**A few questions if you have a moment:**

1. How did the process feel? (Anything we could do better for future participants?)
2. Would you be open to being part of future productions?
3. Anyone you'd recommend we reach out to?

No pressure on any of these — just want to keep learning.

Thanks again for your time and trust.

- Be specific about what you appreciated — generic thanks feel hollow
- Make the 24-hour window clear and easy to use
- Frame feedback as learning, not obligation
- Include editor contact prominently

---

## 4. Follow-Up (If No Response to Edit Window)

**Subject:** Quick check-in before we proceed

Hi [Name],

Just checking in — your 24-hour edit window closes [today at time / has now closed].

If there's nothing you need adjusted, we'll proceed with editing. But if you've been meaning to flag something and haven't had a chance, let me know and we can extend.

Either way, thanks again for being part of this.

[Your name]

---

**Personalisation notes:**
- Only send if you have specific reason to check (e.g., they seemed uncertain during recording)
- Don't send as routine — it can feel pressuring
