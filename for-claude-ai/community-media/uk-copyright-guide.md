# UK Copyright & Fair Dealing Guide

*For Decolonised Discs and other music-featuring content*

---

## Overview

BLKOUT Community Media uses music under UK fair dealing provisions. This guide explains what we can do, what we can't, and how to stay on the right side of copyright law.

**Disclaimer**: This is practical guidance, not legal advice. For complex situations or when significant risk is involved, consult a qualified intellectual property lawyer.

## UK Fair Dealing Basics

Unlike US "fair use" (which is flexible and case-by-case), UK "fair dealing" allows specific uses:

### Permitted Purposes

1. **Research and private study**
2. **Criticism and review**
3. **Quotation**
4. **News reporting**
5. **Caricature, parody, pastiche**

For Decolonised Discs, we primarily rely on **criticism and review** and **quotation**.

### Requirements for Fair Dealing

1. **The dealing must be fair** — Not excessive, not a substitute for the original
2. **The work must have been made available to the public** — Published commercially
3. **Sufficient acknowledgment must be given** — Credit the work and creator

---

## What We Can Do

### Short Clips for Commentary

**Legal basis**: Criticism and review / Quotation

We can play short extracts of commercially released music when:
- The extract is used to discuss, analyze, or reflect on the music
- The commentary (guest's story/memories) is the primary content
- The music extract supports rather than replaces the commentary
- Full credit is given

**Practical guidelines**:
- Keep clips to 15-30 seconds typically
- Never use a clip as "background music" without commentary
- Ensure the guest's discussion is the star, not the music itself

### Identifying Music

We can name:
- Song titles
- Artist names
- Album titles
- Years of release
- Record labels

This is factual information, not copyrighted material.

### Discussing Music

We can discuss:
- The music's sound, style, production
- Its cultural significance
- Personal memories and associations
- Its impact and influence
- Lyrics (limited quotation, with commentary)

### Guest Singing/Humming

If a guest spontaneously sings or hums a snippet:
- Keep it brief (a line or two)
- In context of discussion
- Not a performance

This falls under quotation and likely fair dealing, though more legally grey than recorded clips.

---

## What We Cannot Do

### Full Track Playback
- Never play a song in full
- Never use music as background/intro without commentary
- Never create a "mixtape" style episode that's primarily music

### Creating Substitutes
- Don't use so much of a song that listeners wouldn't need to hear the original
- Don't compile "best bits" that replicate an artist's value

### Unreleased Material
- Demos, bootlegs, leaked tracks = no fair dealing protection
- Private recordings = permission required

### Cover Versions in Episode
- If you perform/record a cover, mechanical licensing applies
- This is different from playing the original commercially released version

### Sync Licensing Situations
- If you want to use music under video (not commentary), you need sync license
- This includes: intro music, background music, montage sequences

---

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### YouTube

YouTube's Content ID system may flag audio even when use is legal.

**If flagged**:
1. You can dispute under fair dealing
2. Provide reasoning: "This is commentary/criticism under UK fair dealing"
3. May need to appeal to human reviewer

**Mitigation**:
- Keep clips short
- Ensure commentary is audible around clips
- Consider timestamps in description showing context

### Spotify/Podcast Platforms

Audio-only platforms generally less aggressive on copyright.
Same principles apply:
- Keep clips short
- Ensure commentary context
- Full credit in show notes

### Social Media Clips

When repurposing for social:
- Even shorter clips (10-15 seconds max)
- Commentary must be visible/audible (captions help)
- Credit in caption/on screen

---

## Required Attribution

Every music use must include:

### Verbal (During Episode)
Host or guest names the song and artist before or after clip plays.

Example: "So this is 'Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang' by Dr. Dre..."

### Written (Show Notes)
```
Music featured in this episode:
- "[Song Title]" by [Artist] ([Album], [Year])

## Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Guest Wants to Feature Obscure Track
**Question**: Does it matter how famous the song is?
**Answer**: No — fair dealing applies equally to obscure and famous works.

### Scenario 2: Playing Instrumental Section
**Question**: Can we use instrumental sections more freely?
**Answer**: No — the recording copyright belongs to the performer/label regardless of lyrics.

### Scenario 3: Two Guests Choose Same Song
**Question**: Can we use a song more than once across episodes?
**Answer**: Yes — each use is assessed independently. Ensure each use has its own commentary context.

### Scenario 4: Song Has Been Removed from Streaming
**Question**: Can we still use it?
**Answer**: If it was commercially released at any point, likely yes. If it was only ever on unofficial channels, be cautious.

### Scenario 5: Guest Wants to Play Their Own Music
**Question**: If guest is a musician playing their own work?
**Answer**: They hold the copyright (usually) so they can grant permission. Get it in writing. Note: label may hold recording rights.

### Scenario 6: Sampling and Interpolations
**Question**: Song we want to use samples another song?
**Answer**: Your fair dealing use of the later song doesn't require clearing the sample — that's the original artist's responsibility. You're fine.

### Scenario 7: Live Recording from Concert
**Question**: Guest wants to discuss a live performance they attended?
**Answer**: Use the commercial release version, not bootleg live recordings.

## Risk Assessment

### Lower Risk
- Short clips (under 20 seconds)
- Established commercial releases
- Clear commentary context
- Full attribution
- Discussion-focused content

### Higher Risk
- Longer clips (over 30 seconds)
- Recently released music
- Minimal commentary around music
- Viral potential clips
- No clear critical purpose

### Highest Risk (Avoid)
- Full songs or near-full songs
- Music as background without commentary
- No attribution
- Claiming ownership
- Monetizing primarily on the music value

## If We Receive a Takedown

### YouTube/Platform Takedown

1. **Don't panic** — Fair dealing is a legal defense
2. **Review the use** — Is our use genuinely fair?
3. **Dispute if appropriate** — Platforms have processes
4. **Document everything** — Correspondence, our reasoning
5. **Consider consultation** — If significant, get legal advice

### Direct Cease and Desist

If we receive a letter from a rights holder:

1. **Take seriously** — Respond promptly and professionally
2. **Don't remove immediately** — Unless clearly in the wrong
3. **Explain our position** — Fair dealing for criticism/review
4. **Seek advice** — This is where a lawyer helps
5. **Negotiate if needed** — Sometimes compromise is sensible

## Licensing Alternatives

If fair dealing doesn't cover a use, options include:

### Mechanical License
- For audio-only cover versions
- UK: Via MCPS (Mechanical Copyright Protection Society)

### Sync License
- For music accompanying video
- Negotiate directly with publisher/label
- Can be expensive

### Creative Commons / Royalty-Free
- Some artists release under permissive licenses
- Check terms carefully
- Still credit appropriately

### BLKOUT Licensed Tracks
- Our 12 licensed tracks can be used freely in productions
- See music library section of the skill instructions

## Checklist: Before Using Music

- [ ] Is the music supporting the conversation, not the main attraction?
- [ ] Have we credited the song, artist, and album?
- [ ] Is this clearly criticism/review or quotation, not just entertainment?
- [ ] Have we documented our fair dealing reasoning?

If all boxes are checked, proceed with reasonable confidence.
