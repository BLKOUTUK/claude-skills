# Relay / Baton: Guest Briefing

*One conversation leads to the next.*

---

## What is Relay?

Relay is BLKOUT's conversational interview series. Each episode features one person in conversation with a BLKOUT host. At the end of each episode, you pass the baton — nominating someone from your own network to be featured next.

The result is a chain of connection: each guest is chosen by the person before them, creating a map of Black queer community as it actually exists, through relationship rather than algorithm.

## The Vibe

- **Conversation, not interview** — You're talking with someone, not performing for an audience
- **Your story, your terms** — You decide what to share and how deep to go
- **Curiosity over interrogation** — We're interested in you, not trying to catch you out
- **The baton matters** — Your nomination shapes where this goes next

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Pre-conversation call** — 15-minute chat with your host to meet each other and discuss themes
2. **No questions in advance** — We want genuine conversation, not rehearsed answers
3. **Think about your baton** — Who from your life would you want to hear from?

### During Recording

- **Duration**: ~60-75 minutes recording (edited to ~40-50 minutes)
- **Format**: One-on-one conversation (video call or in-person)
- **Style**: Flowing dialogue — expect tangents, laughter, real talk
- **Closing**: You'll pass the baton on camera

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — Request any cuts within 24 hours
- **Draft review** — You'll hear/see the edit before publication
- **Baton follow-up** — We'll ask you to introduce us to your nominee

---

## Themes We Might Explore

Every conversation is different, shaped by who you are. But here are the kinds of things that often come up:

- **Your path** — How did you get where you are? What shaped you?
- **Community** — Where do you find your people? What does belonging feel like?
- **Work/craft** — What do you do and why does it matter to you?
- **Joy** — What brings you alive? What do you love?
- **Challenges** — What have you navigated? What did it teach you?
- **Vision** — What do you hope for? What are you building toward?

**You're never obligated to discuss anything you don't want to.** The conversation follows your comfort, not a script.

---

## The Baton

At the end of your episode, you'll pass the baton to someone else.

### How to Choose

Your nominee should be:
- Someone you know personally (not a celebrity you admire from afar)
- Someone whose story you'd genuinely want to hear
- Someone who identifies as Black and queer (however they define those terms)

They don't need to be famous, accomplished, or "impressive." The point is relationship — who matters to you?

### What Happens Next

1. You'll name them on camera: "I'm passing the baton to [name] because..."
2. After recording, we'll ask you to make an introduction (email or message)
3. They're free to accept or decline — no pressure either way
4. If they decline or don't respond, we'll ask you for an alternative

**Note**: You can discuss your choice with us before recording if you want to check anything.

# Hard Pressed: Guest Briefing

*Welcome to Hard Pressed — where we get into it.*

---

## What is Hard Pressed?

Hard Pressed is BLKOUT's panel discussion format. Think less Question Time, more Loose Women — a group of Black queer people talking honestly about life, culture, politics, and everything in between.

Each episode explores 2-3 topics, mixing the serious with the light, the personal with the political. We're not here for gotcha moments or performance debates. We're here for real conversation.

## The Vibe

- **Brave space, not safe space** — We can't guarantee safety, but we can guarantee care
- **No wrong answers** — Your perspective is yours; you don't represent anyone else
- **Less prep, more presence** — Come as you are, not as you think you should be
- **Disagreement is welcome** — But we disagree with ideas, not people

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Topics shared in advance** — You'll receive 2-3 topic areas at least 48 hours before recording
2. **No script required** — These are conversation starters, not exam questions
3. **Your object** — Bring something meaningful to you (we'll explain more below)

### During Recording

- **Duration**: ~90 minutes total recording (edited to ~45-60 minutes)
- **Format**: Video call or in-person (you'll be told which)
- **Topics**: ~10-15 minutes per topic, flowing naturally
- **Style**: Discussion, not interview — everyone participates

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — You can request cuts within 24 hours of recording
- **Draft review** — You'll see the edit before publication
- **Publication notice** — We'll let you know when it goes live

---

## "The Subject as Object"

At the start of each episode, we ask each guest to introduce themselves through **an object that means something to them**.

This isn't about showing off or finding the "right" answer. It's about starting from something real. Your object might be:

- Something you carry every day
- Something from your childhood
- Something you made
- Something someone gave you
- Something you're wearing right now

When we record, you'll have ~2 minutes to share your object and why it matters. This becomes your introduction — not your job title, not your bio, just you.

**Note**: If your object involves other people's stories (e.g., a gift from someone), you can share your relationship to it without naming them.

---

## Topics for This Episode

*[To be completed by producer before sending]*

### Topic 1: [Title]
[Brief description — 2-3 sentences framing the conversation]

### Topic 2: [Title]

**Note**: These are starting points. Conversations go where they go — that's the point.

# Theme Discussion: Contributor Briefing

*Going deep on what matters.*

---

## What is Theme Discussion?

Theme Discussion is BLKOUT's format for exploring a single topic in depth. Each episode gathers multiple voices around one theme — not to reach consensus, but to map the territory of how Black queer people think about, experience, and navigate a particular subject.

This isn't a debate. It's more like a collective meditation — different perspectives illuminating different facets of the same question.

## The Vibe

- **Depth over breadth** — One topic, fully explored
- **Many truths** — Your perspective adds to the picture; it doesn't need to be the whole picture
- **Thinking aloud welcome** — You don't need to have it all figured out
- **Disagreement as data** — If you see it differently, that's valuable information

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Theme shared in advance** — You'll know the topic and key questions at least one week before recording
2. **Reflection prompts** — Optional prompts to help you think through your perspective
3. **No research required** — We want your experience and thinking, not a position paper

### Recording Format

Theme Discussions can be recorded in different ways:

- **Group session**: Multiple contributors together (like Hard Pressed but single-topic)
- **Individual interviews**: Separate conversations edited together
- **Hybrid**: Some combination of both

You'll be told which format applies to your episode.

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — Request any cuts within 24 hours
- **Context check** — If your words are edited alongside others, we'll ensure context is preserved
- **Draft review** — You'll see how you appear in the edit before publication

---

## This Episode's Theme

### Theme: [Title]

*[To be completed by producer]*

[2-3 paragraphs framing the theme — what it is, why it matters, what we're curious about]

### Key Questions

We'll explore questions like:

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
3. [Question 3]

**These are starting points, not a checklist.** The conversation will find its own path.

### Reflection Prompts (Optional)

If it's helpful, you might spend some time thinking about:

- [Prompt 1]
- [Prompt 2]
- [Prompt 3]

You don't need to write anything down or prepare formal answers. These are just invitations to reflect.

# Decolonised Discs: Guest Briefing

*The music that made us.*

---

## What is Decolonised Discs?

Decolonised Discs is BLKOUT's music-led conversation format. You choose the tracks; we follow the stories. Each episode features one guest sharing songs that have shaped them — not a "best of" list or a display of taste, but a musical autobiography.

The format is inspired by Desert Island Discs, but centred on Black queer experience and freed from the colonial nostalgia of that format. We're interested in music as memory, identity, survival, joy, and liberation.

## The Vibe

- **Your music, your reasons** — No justification needed for your choices
- **Stories over analysis** — We're not reviewing the songs; we're following where they take you
- **The personal is political** — But it doesn't have to be heavy; joy counts too
- **No guilty pleasures** — If you love it, it belongs here

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Choose your tracks** — Select 6-8 songs that matter to you (see guidance below)
2. **Share your list** — Send us your tracks at least one week before recording
3. **Optional notes** — You can share a few words about each track, or save it all for the conversation

### During Recording

- **Duration**: ~90 minutes recording (edited to ~60 minutes)
- **Format**: One-on-one conversation with host
- **Structure**: We'll work through your tracks, letting each one open a conversation
- **Music**: We'll play clips during recording (see copyright note below)

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — Request any cuts within 24 hours
- **Draft review** — You'll hear the edit before publication
- **Music clearance** — We'll handle the copyright considerations (see below)

---

## Choosing Your Tracks

### How Many?
Choose **6-8 songs**. This gives us enough for a full episode with room for the conversation to breathe.

### What Kind?
Any genre, any era, any language. The only criterion is: **this song matters to you**.

Consider songs that:
- Remind you of a specific time or place
- Helped you understand something about yourself
- Got you through something difficult
- Connect you to family, community, or culture
- Simply bring you joy
- Changed how you heard music
- You're almost embarrassed to admit you love

### Selection Tips

- **Mix it up** — Different moods, different eras, different stories
- **Be honest** — The "impressive" choice is less interesting than the true one
- **Include joy** — Not everything needs to be profound or painful
- **Trust yourself** — If you keep thinking about a song, it probably belongs on your list

### What We Need From You

For each track, please provide:
- Song title
- Artist
- Album (if you know it)
- Year (approximately, if you know it)

You can also include a sentence about why you chose it, but this is optional — you might prefer to save the story for the conversation.

---

## Copyright & Music Use

### What Happens in the Episode

We want to use your chosen music in the published episode. Here's how we navigate copyright:

**During Recording**
- We'll play clips of your tracks as conversation prompts
- This helps anchor the discussion and jog memory

**In the Published Episode**
- We'll include short clips (typically 15-30 seconds) under UK fair dealing provisions
- Clips are used for "criticism, review, or quotation" — your commentary is the primary content
- We clearly identify all tracks (title, artist)

**What Fair Dealing Allows**
Under UK copyright law, we can use limited extracts for criticism and review provided:
- The use is "fair" (short clips, not replacements for the original)
- The work has been made available to the public
- Sufficient acknowledgment is given

**What This Means for You**
- You can choose any commercially released song
- We handle the copyright considerations — you don't need to clear anything
- If a specific track proves problematic, we'll discuss alternatives with you

### Limitations

We may not be able to use:
- Very long clips (we keep it short)
- Unreleased or private recordings without permission
- Tracks where the entire value would be the music itself rather than your commentary

If any of your choices raise issues, we'll talk to you about it before publication.
