# Relay / Baton: Guest Briefing

*One conversation leads to the next.*

---

## What is Relay?

Relay is BLKOUT's conversational interview series. Each episode features one person in conversation with a BLKOUT host. At the end of each episode, you pass the baton — nominating someone from your own network to be featured next.

The result is a chain of connection: each guest is chosen by the person before them, creating a map of Black queer community as it actually exists, through relationship rather than algorithm.

## The Vibe

- **Conversation, not interview** — You're talking with someone, not performing for an audience
- **Your story, your terms** — You decide what to share and how deep to go
- **Curiosity over interrogation** — We're interested in you, not trying to catch you out
- **The baton matters** — Your nomination shapes where this goes next

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Pre-conversation call** — 15-minute chat with your host to meet each other and discuss themes
2. **No questions in advance** — We want genuine conversation, not rehearsed answers
3. **Think about your baton** — Who from your life would you want to hear from?

### During Recording

- **Duration**: ~60-75 minutes recording (edited to ~40-50 minutes)
- **Format**: One-on-one conversation (video call or in-person)
- **Style**: Flowing dialogue — expect tangents, laughter, real talk
- **Closing**: You'll pass the baton on camera

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — Request any cuts within 24 hours
- **Draft review** — You'll hear/see the edit before publication
- **Baton follow-up** — We'll ask you to introduce us to your nominee

## Themes We Might Explore

Every conversation is different, shaped by who you are. But here are the kinds of things that often come up:

- **Your path** — How did you get where you are? What shaped you?
- **Community** — Where do you find your people? What does belonging feel like?
- **Work/craft** — What do you do and why does it matter to you?
- **Joy** — What brings you alive? What do you love?
- **Challenges** — What have you navigated? What did it teach you?
- **Vision** — What do you hope for? What are you building toward?

**You're never obligated to discuss anything you don't want to.** The conversation follows your comfort, not a script.

## The Baton

At the end of your episode, you'll pass the baton to someone else.

### How to Choose

Your nominee should be:
- Someone you know personally (not a celebrity you admire from afar)
- Someone whose story you'd genuinely want to hear
- Someone who identifies as Black and queer (however they define those terms)

They don't need to be famous, accomplished, or "impressive." The point is relationship — who matters to you?

### What Happens Next

1. You'll name them on camera: "I'm passing the baton to [name] because..."
2. After recording, we'll ask you to make an introduction (email or message)
3. They're free to accept or decline — no pressure either way
4. If they decline or don't respond, we'll ask you for an alternative

**Note**: You can discuss your choice with us before recording if you want to check anything.
