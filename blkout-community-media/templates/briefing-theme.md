# Theme Discussion: Contributor Briefing

*Going deep on what matters.*

---

## What is Theme Discussion?

Theme Discussion is BLKOUT's format for exploring a single topic in depth. Each episode gathers multiple voices around one theme — not to reach consensus, but to map the territory of how Black queer people think about, experience, and navigate a particular subject.

This isn't a debate. It's more like a collective meditation — different perspectives illuminating different facets of the same question.

## The Vibe

- **Depth over breadth** — One topic, fully explored
- **Many truths** — Your perspective adds to the picture; it doesn't need to be the whole picture
- **Thinking aloud welcome** — You don't need to have it all figured out
- **Disagreement as data** — If you see it differently, that's valuable information

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Theme shared in advance** — You'll know the topic and key questions at least one week before recording
2. **Reflection prompts** — Optional prompts to help you think through your perspective
3. **No research required** — We want your experience and thinking, not a position paper

### Recording Format

Theme Discussions can be recorded in different ways:

- **Group session**: Multiple contributors together (like Hard Pressed but single-topic)
- **Individual interviews**: Separate conversations edited together
- **Hybrid**: Some combination of both

You'll be told which format applies to your episode.

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — Request any cuts within 24 hours
- **Context check** — If your words are edited alongside others, we'll ensure context is preserved
- **Draft review** — You'll see how you appear in the edit before publication

## This Episode's Theme

### Theme: [Title]

*[To be completed by producer]*

### Key Questions

We'll explore questions like:

1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]

**These are starting points, not a checklist.** The conversation will find its own path.

### Reflection Prompts (Optional)

If it's helpful, you might spend some time thinking about:

- [Prompt 1]
- [Prompt 2]
- [Prompt 3]

You don't need to write anything down or prepare formal answers. These are just invitations to reflect.
