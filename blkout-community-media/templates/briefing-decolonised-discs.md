# Decolonised Discs: Guest Briefing

*The music that made us.*

---

## What is Decolonised Discs?

Decolonised Discs is BLKOUT's music-led conversation format. You choose the tracks; we follow the stories. Each episode features one guest sharing songs that have shaped them — not a "best of" list or a display of taste, but a musical autobiography.

The format is inspired by Desert Island Discs, but centred on Black queer experience and freed from the colonial nostalgia of that format. We're interested in music as memory, identity, survival, joy, and liberation.

## The Vibe

- **Your music, your reasons** — No justification needed for your choices
- **Stories over analysis** — We're not reviewing the songs; we're following where they take you
- **The personal is political** — But it doesn't have to be heavy; joy counts too
- **No guilty pleasures** — If you love it, it belongs here

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Choose your tracks** — Select 6-8 songs that matter to you (see guidance below)
2. **Share your list** — Send us your tracks at least one week before recording
3. **Optional notes** — You can share a few words about each track, or save it all for the conversation

### During Recording

- **Duration**: ~90 minutes recording (edited to ~60 minutes)
- **Format**: One-on-one conversation with host
- **Structure**: We'll work through your tracks, letting each one open a conversation
- **Music**: We'll play clips during recording (see copyright note below)

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — Request any cuts within 24 hours
- **Draft review** — You'll hear the edit before publication
- **Music clearance** — We'll handle the copyright considerations (see below)

## Choosing Your Tracks

### How Many?
Choose **6-8 songs**. This gives us enough for a full episode with room for the conversation to breathe.

### What Kind?
Any genre, any era, any language. The only criterion is: **this song matters to you**.

Consider songs that:
- Remind you of a specific time or place
- Helped you understand something about yourself
- Got you through something difficult
- Connect you to family, community, or culture
- Simply bring you joy
- Changed how you heard music
- You're almost embarrassed to admit you love

### Selection Tips

- **Mix it up** — Different moods, different eras, different stories
- **Be honest** — The "impressive" choice is less interesting than the true one
- **Include joy** — Not everything needs to be profound or painful
- **Trust yourself** — If you keep thinking about a song, it probably belongs on your list

### What We Need From You

For each track, please provide:
- Song title
- Artist
- Album (if you know it)
- Year (approximately, if you know it)

You can also include a sentence about why you chose it, but this is optional — you might prefer to save the story for the conversation.

## Copyright & Music Use

### What Happens in the Episode

We want to use your chosen music in the published episode. Here's how we navigate copyright:

**During Recording**
- We'll play clips of your tracks as conversation prompts
- This helps anchor the discussion and jog memory

**In the Published Episode**
- We'll include short clips (typically 15-30 seconds) under UK fair dealing provisions
- Clips are used for "criticism, review, or quotation" — your commentary is the primary content
- We clearly identify all tracks (title, artist)

**What Fair Dealing Allows**
Under UK copyright law, we can use limited extracts for criticism and review provided:
- The use is "fair" (short clips, not replacements for the original)
- The work has been made available to the public
- Sufficient acknowledgment is given

**What This Means for You**
- You can choose any commercially released song
- We handle the copyright considerations — you don't need to clear anything
- If a specific track proves problematic, we'll discuss alternatives with you

### Limitations

We may not be able to use:
- Very long clips (we keep it short)
- Unreleased or private recordings without permission
- Tracks where the entire value would be the music itself rather than your commentary

If any of your choices raise issues, we'll talk to you about it before publication.
