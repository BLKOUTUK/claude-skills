# Hard Pressed: Guest Briefing

*Welcome to Hard Pressed — where we get into it.*

---

## What is Hard Pressed?

Hard Pressed is BLKOUT's panel discussion format. Think less Question Time, more Loose Women — a group of Black queer people talking honestly about life, culture, politics, and everything in between.

Each episode explores 2-3 topics, mixing the serious with the light, the personal with the political. We're not here for gotcha moments or performance debates. We're here for real conversation.

## The Vibe

- **Brave space, not safe space** — We can't guarantee safety, but we can guarantee care
- **No wrong answers** — Your perspective is yours; you don't represent anyone else
- **Less prep, more presence** — Come as you are, not as you think you should be
- **Disagreement is welcome** — But we disagree with ideas, not people

## What to Expect

### Before Recording

1. **Topics shared in advance** — You'll receive 2-3 topic areas at least 48 hours before recording
2. **No script required** — These are conversation starters, not exam questions
3. **Your object** — Bring something meaningful to you (we'll explain more below)

### During Recording

- **Duration**: ~90 minutes total recording (edited to ~45-60 minutes)
- **Format**: Video call or in-person (you'll be told which)
- **Topics**: ~10-15 minutes per topic, flowing naturally
- **Style**: Discussion, not interview — everyone participates

### After Recording

- **24-hour edit window** — You can request cuts within 24 hours of recording
- **Draft review** — You'll see the edit before publication
- **Publication notice** — We'll let you know when it goes live

## "The Subject as Object"

At the start of each episode, we ask each guest to introduce themselves through **an object that means something to them**.

This isn't about showing off or finding the "right" answer. It's about starting from something real. Your object might be:

- Something you carry every day
- Something from your childhood
- Something you made
- Something someone gave you
- Something you're wearing right now

When we record, you'll have ~2 minutes to share your object and why it matters. This becomes your introduction — not your job title, not your bio, just you.

**Note**: If your object involves other people's stories (e.g., a gift from someone), you can share your relationship to it without naming them.
