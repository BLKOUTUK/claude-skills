# Repurposing Guide: Derivative Content

*Extending the life of community media while respecting its origins.*

---

## Principles

Content created with BLKOUT has multiple potential lives. Each derivative use should:

1. **Honor the original** — Maintain the spirit and meaning
2. **Credit properly** — Attribution is non-negotiable
3. **Assess permissions** — Some uses require additional consent
4. **Add value** — Derivatives should serve community, not just extract

## Sunset Considerations

Some content may have natural expiry:
- Time-sensitive topics
- Participant role changes
- Organizational changes
- Participant requests

**Annual review questions**:
- Is this content still accurate?
- Would participant still want this public?
- Does it still represent BLKOUT's values?
- Should it be archived rather than actively promoted?
