# BLKOUT Animated Logo Ident System

**Brand Recognition • Visual Unity • Liberation Aesthetic**

---

## Overview

The BLKOUT animated logo ident is a transparent video element designed to build brand recognition and unify content across all platforms. Each variation embodies BLKOUT's values: revolutionary energy, Black queer solidarity, cooperative ownership, and liberation.

**Core Purpose**: Create a recognizable visual signature that:
- Opens or closes BLKOUT content
- Reinforces brand identity
- Centers Black queer men's solidarity
- Works across all platforms and contexts

**Key Principle**: Every ident animation tells a story of collective power, solidarity, and liberation for Black queer men in the UK.

---

## Animation Styles

### Motion Philosophy
**"Revolutionary Energy with Intentional Pacing"**

**Logo Build**: 0.5-1.0s, ease-out
**Hold**: 1.0-2.0s depending on ident length
**Fade Out**: 0.3-0.5s, ease-out

**Particle Movement**: Slow drift (10-20% screen height over full duration)
**Glow Pulse**: 2-3s cycle, 10-15% opacity variation
**Breathing Motion**: 3-4s cycle, 2-5% scale variation

## Audio Design Recommendations

### Sound Philosophy
**"Warm, Grounding, and Affirming"**

- Not aggressive or jarring
- Welcoming but confident
- Culturally resonant (consider UK grime, Afrobeats influences if appropriate)
- Accessible (not too loud or harsh)

### Audio Elements

**Bass/Percussion**:
- Grounding, rhythmic foundation
- Can reference UK music scenes (grime bass, Afrobeats drums)

**Synth Pads**:
- Warm, enveloping tones
- Liberation Teal translated to sound = calm, hopeful

**Melody/Motif**:
- Simple, memorable 3-5 note pattern
- Could become sonic brand identity
- Warm Gold translated to sound = bright, welcoming

**Accents**:
- Subtle whooshes or sweeps with animations
- Never overpowering or cheesy

### Mixing Guidelines

- Peak level: -3dB (leave headroom)
- Average level: -12dB to -18dB
- Stereo field: Center-weighted, subtle stereo width
- Low-end: Present but not boomy (100-200Hz)
- Export: WAV 48kHz/24-bit (sync to video)

### Audio Variations

**With Music**: Full mix with melody, rhythm, ambience
**Minimal**: Bass + single tone (for contexts where audio needs to be subtle)
**Silent**: No audio track (for environments where audio is not appropriate)

Provide all three versions for maximum flexibility.

## Brand Alignment

### How Idents Embody BLKOUT Values

**For and By Black Queer Men**:
- Raised fist imagery centers Black queer solidarity
- Multiple brown tones celebrate community diversity
- Logo held by fist = owned by community

**Liberation Technology**:
- Revolutionary aesthetic rejects corporate minimalism
- Bold visuals assert unapologetic presence

**Democratic Governance**:
- Collective imagery (fist) over individual
- No hierarchy in visual composition
- Accessible design (transparency, clean layouts)

**Cooperative Ownership**:
- Fist holding logo literally visualizes community ownership
- Warm, welcoming colors suggest inclusion
- Shared power communicated through solidarity symbol

**UK Context**:

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### Visual Accessibility

**Color Contrast**:
- BLKOUT Red on transparent/white: 5.9:1 (WCAG AA ✅)
- Ensure any text meets 4.5:1 minimum
- Avoid red text on brown fist background

**Motion Sensitivity**:
- Avoid strobing or rapid flashing
- Keep animations smooth and organic
- Provide static logo alternative for motion-sensitive contexts

**Clarity**:
- Logo must be readable at small sizes
- Test idents at 480p, 720p, 1080p
- Avoid overly complex backgrounds

### Audio Accessibility

**Volume**:
- Not too loud or jarring
- Should work well when user device volume is at 50%

**Captions**:
- Not required for idents (no spoken content)
- But if tagline has audio voiceover, provide captions

**Alternative**:
- Always provide silent version
- Some users auto-mute video content
