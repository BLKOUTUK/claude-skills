# BLKOUT UK Context & Considerations

**For and By Black Queer Men in the United Kingdom**

---

## Community Specificity

### Who We Serve
**Black queer men in the UK** - this specificity is central to everything BLKOUT does.

**This means**:
- Centering Black queer masculine experiences
- UK-specific cultural and political context
- Addressing UK-specific challenges and systems
- Building power specifically for Black queer men
- Creating space by and for the community

### What This Isn't
- Not a pan-LGBTQ+ platform (though allied)
- Not US-focused (UK context matters)
- Not charity or service provision (community-owned liberation)
- Not trying to serve everyone (intentionally specific)
