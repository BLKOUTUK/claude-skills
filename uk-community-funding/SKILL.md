# UK Community Funding

A learning skill. The guidance here reflects what we currently understand — it will be wrong in places and should improve with every application cycle.

**Confidence key:**
- **Tested** — We've used this approach and received positive feedback
- **Promising** — We've tried it once or twice, seems to work, needs more evidence
- **Untested** — Reasonable assumption, not yet validated with funders
- **Learned the hard way** — Something we got wrong and corrected

## How This Skill Works

1. When writing an application, reference `knowledge/` for BLKOUT's core facts
2. Check `applications/` for what we've submitted before to similar funders
3. Check `feedback/` for what funders have actually told us
4. After submission, log the application
5. After hearing back, log the feedback — especially rejections, they teach more

**The most valuable thing in this skill is the feedback log. Protect it.**

## Knowledge: What Doesn't Change Between Applications

### Who We Are (core facts)

**Organisation:** BLKOUT
**Legal status:** [Update when incorporated — currently unincorporated / CIC / Co-op]
**Founded:** 2016 (10th anniversary February 2026)
**Location:** UK-wide, primarily London-based activities
**Beneficiaries:** Black queer men in the UK
**Model:** Community-owned platform, cooperative governance principles

### What We Do (theory of change — current version)

**Problem statement:**
Black queer men in the UK face compounding marginalisation — racism within LGBTQ+ spaces, homophobia within Black communities, and erasure from mainstream services. Existing support infrastructure was not designed by or for this community.

**Our approach:**
Community-owned digital infrastructure and in-person programming that centres Black queer men's experiences, builds collective power, and models democratic governance.

**Activities:**
- Digital platform (blkoutuk.com) — events, news, resources, community hub
- IVOR AI assistant — culturally competent information and support
- Events calendar — curating and surfacing community events across the UK
- Communications intelligence — newsletter, social media, content
- Governance development — building cooperative ownership structures

**Outcomes we claim:**
- [Untested] Increased sense of belonging and connection among Black queer men
- [Untested] Better access to relevant events, resources, and services
- [Untested] Community capacity building through democratic participation
- [Untested] Digital sovereignty — community controls its own data and platforms

**Outcomes we can evidence:**
- [Update with actual metrics as they become available]
- Newsletter subscribers: ~2,000
- Platform: active, serving content since 2016
- Events surfaced: [number]
- 10 years of continuous operation

> **Note to self:** Our outcomes are currently assertion-based. As we gather evaluation data, move claims from "Untested" to "Promising" or "Tested" with evidence references.

### What Makes Us Different

- **Community-owned** — not a charity doing things for people, a cooperative doing things as people
- **Tech-forward** — building digital infrastructure, not just using third-party platforms
- **Intersectional specificity** — not LGBTQ+ generally, not Black communities generally, but Black queer men specifically
- **UK context** — not importing US models, grounded in UK realities (NHS, legal landscape, cultural context)
- **10 years of operation** — longevity demonstrates genuine community rootedness

### Financial Position

- [Update: current annual turnover/budget]
- [Update: existing funding sources]
- [Update: reserves position]
- [Update: volunteer hours / in-kind contributions]

## Approach: How We Currently Write Applications

### Before Writing

1. **Research the funder** — What have they funded before? What language do they use? What's their theory of change?
2. **Check our feedback log** — Have we applied to them before? What did they say?
3. **Check fit** — Does what they fund actually match what we do, or are we bending ourselves to fit?
4. **Talk to them first** — Most UK funders welcome pre-application conversations. Use them. Ask what they're looking for.

### Framing Principles (current understanding)

**[Untested] Lead with the community, not the tech:**
Funders fund people and outcomes, not platforms. The technology is how we deliver, not what we deliver. Lead with Black queer men's lives, not with the app.

**[Untested] Name the gap without performing pain:**
Be specific about the problem without reducing the community to its struggles. Black queer men are not just a problem to be solved — they're a community with power, joy, and agency that deserves investment.

**[Untested] Cooperative model as asset, not complication:**
Some funders are nervous about cooperative structures. Frame it as: stronger governance, deeper community buy-in, more sustainable than founder-dependent models.

**[Untested] 10 years = credibility:**
A decade of operation with limited funding demonstrates genuine community commitment, not grant-dependency.

**[Learned the hard way] Don't overstate digital reach:**
Email subscriber numbers can be misleading (SendFox suppressed ~1,994 of 2,000 subscribers due to engagement scoring). Be honest about engaged vs. total reach. Funders respect honesty about metrics.

### Structure We Currently Use

1. **Need / Context** — The situation for Black queer men in the UK (with evidence)
2. **Our response** — What we do about it (activities, not just aspirations)
3. **Why us** — What makes BLKOUT the right organisation (10 years, community-owned, specificity)
4. **What we're asking for** — Specific, budgeted, time-bound
5. **How we'll know it's working** — Monitoring and evaluation approach
6. **Sustainability** — What happens after the funding ends

### Common Funder Questions We Should Be Ready For

- How do you involve your beneficiaries in decision-making? → Cooperative governance model
- How do you reach the most marginalised? → [Need stronger answer here]
- What's your safeguarding approach? → [Need to document]
- How will this be sustained? → Platform model, cooperative membership, diversified funding
- What's your evidence base? → [Currently thin — need to strengthen]

## UK Funding Landscape (what we know)

### Funder Types

**Trusts and foundations** — Independent grant-makers (e.g., Trust for London, Lloyds Bank Foundation, Paul Hamlyn). Usually project or core funding. Most welcoming of pre-application conversations.

**National Lottery** — Community Fund, Heritage Fund, etc. Larger pots, more competitive, longer timelines. Strong emphasis on community involvement in design.

**Statutory funding** — Local authority, NHS, government contracts. Tend toward service delivery, less comfortable with advocacy or community power framing.

**Corporate foundations** — Companies with CSR/giving arms. Shorter-term, often prefer visible/photogenic projects. Can be worth it for capacity building.

**Philanthropic / individual donors** — Less formal, relationship-based. BLKOUT hasn't explored this much yet.

### Terminology

UK funders use specific language. Getting it right signals sector familiarity:

- **VCSE** — Voluntary, Community, and Social Enterprise sector
- **Core costs / core funding** — Running the organisation (rent, salaries, admin). Hard to get, very valuable.
- **Restricted / unrestricted** — Restricted funding can only be spent on specific activities. Unrestricted is rare and precious.
- **Theory of change** — How your activities lead to outcomes lead to impact. Funders expect this.
- **Beneficiaries** — People your work serves. Some funders prefer "participants" or "community members."
- **Lived experience** — The community you serve has direct experience of the issues. Increasingly valued.
- **Co-production / co-design** — Designing services with the community, not for them. BLKOUT's cooperative model is strong here.
- **Place-based** — Focused on a geographic area. BLKOUT is UK-wide, which some funders find harder to fund.
- **Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI)** — Framework funders use. BLKOUT's existence IS this, don't let it become a checkbox.
- **Systems change** — Changing the conditions that create problems, not just addressing symptoms. BLKOUT's cooperative/platform model is a systems change argument.

## Pipeline: Known Opportunities

| Funder | Opportunity | Amount | Status | Notes |
|--------|------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Trust for London | BLKOUTNXT: Economic Futures | ~£200k | EOI stage | [Update with feedback] |
| [Add as identified] | | | | |

> **Keep this updated.** Every funder conversation, every application, every outcome belongs here.

## Review Protocol

### Before Submitting Any Application

- [ ] Have we spoken to the funder? What did they say?
- [ ] Have we checked our feedback log for similar funders?
- [ ] Does someone outside the writing process read it for clarity?
- [ ] Are our outcome claims honest? (Check confidence levels)
- [ ] Have we budgeted realistically, including core costs?
- [ ] Does it sound like BLKOUT, not like a generic charity?

### After Hearing Back

**If successful:**
- Log in `applications/` — what worked
- Note which framing they responded to
- Update confidence levels in this skill

**If unsuccessful:**
- **Always ask for feedback** — most funders will give it
- Log feedback verbatim in `feedback/`
- Update this skill based on what they said
- Don't take it personally — fit matters more than quality

**If given feedback on a draft (rare and valuable):**
- Log every comment
- This is the highest-value learning material
- Update skill guidance based on their specific concerns

## What We Don't Know Yet

Honest list of gaps in our understanding:

- How funders perceive cooperative ownership models (positive? confusing? risky?)
- Whether our "digital platform" framing lands or sounds too tech-startup
- How to evidence outcomes for a community that's been underserved by research
- Whether our UK-wide scope is an asset or a barrier to place-based funders
- The right balance between specificity (Black queer men) and broader framing (LGBTQ+ / Black communities)
- How to talk about AI (IVOR) without triggering funder scepticism about tech

Each application cycle should shrink this list.
